Linear Mixed Models
*******************

Linear mixed models (LMMs) are a generalisation of linear models [#f1]_ to allow the
ouctome to be described as a summation of both fixed and random effects [#f2]_.
LMM inference is implemented by the :mod:`glimix_core.lmm` module and described here.

Introduction
============

A LMM can be described as ::

    𝐲 = X𝜷 + G𝐮 + 𝛜,

where 𝐮 ∼ 𝓝(𝟎, v₀I) is a
vector of random effects and \epsilonᵢ are iid Normal random variables
with zero-mean and variance v₁ each.
The outcome-vector is thus distributed according to ::

    𝐲 ∼ 𝓝(X𝜷, v₀GGᵀ + v₁I)

The :class:`.LMM` class provides a FastLMM [#f3]_
implementation to perform inference over the variance parameters
v₀ and v₁ and over the vector
𝜷 of fixed-effect sizes.
An instance of this class is created by providing the outcome ``y``,
the covariates ``X``, and the covariance ``K`` via its economic eigendecomposition.
Here is an example:

.. doctest::

    >>> from numpy import ones
    >>> from numpy_sugar.linalg import economic_qs_linear
    >>>
    >>> from glimix_core.lmm import LMM
    >>>
    >>> G = [[1, 2], [3, -1], [1.1, 0.5], [0.5, -0.4]]
    >>> QS = economic_qs_linear(G)
    >>> X = ones((4, 1))
    >>> y = [-1, 2, 0.3, 0.5]
    >>> lmm = LMM(y, X, QS)
    >>> lmm.fit(verbose=False)
    >>> lmm.lml()  # doctest: +FLOAT_CMP
    -2.2726234086180557

The method :func:`.LMM.fit` is called to optimise the marginal
likelihood over the fixed-effect sizes 𝜷 and over the
variances v₀ and v₁.
The resulting values for the above inference are:

.. doctest::

    >>> lmm.beta[0]  # doctest: +FLOAT_CMP
    0.0664650291693258
    >>> lmm.v0  # doctest: +FLOAT_CMP
    0.33736446158226896
    >>> lmm.v1  # doctest: +FLOAT_CMP
    0.012503600451739165

We also provide :class:`.FastScanner`,
an approximated LMM implementation for performing an even faster
inference across several (millions, for example) covariates independently.
More detail about this approach is given in the `Association scan`_ section.

Multi-Trait
===========

This package also provides a variant of LMM that models multiple outcomes (or traits) of
the same set of samples.
Let p be the number of traits.
The outcome matrix Y is the concatenation of p vectors::

    Y = [𝐲₀ 𝐲₁ ... 𝐲ₚ].

The mean definition will involve three matrices::

    M = (A ⊗ F) vec(B),

where vec(·) stacks the columns of the input matrix into a single-column matrix.
B is a c×p matrix of effect sizes for c being the number of covariates.
A is a p×p design matrix that determines the covariance between the traits over the mean
vector.
F is a n×p design matrix of covariates.

The covariance matrix will be::

    K = C₀ ⊗ GGᵀ + C₁ ⊗ I.

C₀ and C₁ are p×p symmetric matrices whose values will be optimized.
GGᵀ gives the covariance between samples, while (C₀ ⊗ GGᵀ) gives the covariance between
samples when traits are taken into account.

Putting the outcome, mean, and covariance-matrix together, we have the distribution ::

    vec(Y) ~ N((A ⊗ F) vec(B), K = C₀ ⊗ GGᵀ + C₁ ⊗ I).

The parameters of the multi-trait LMM to be fit via maximum likelihood are the matrices
B, C₀, and C₁.

.. doctest::

    >>> from numpy.random import RandomState
    >>> from glimix_core.lmm import Kron2Sum
    >>>
    >>> random = RandomState(0)
    >>> n = 5
    >>> p = 2
    >>> c = 3
    >>> Y = random.randn(n, p)
    >>> A = random.randn(p, p)
    >>> A = A @ A.T
    >>> F = random.randn(n, c)
    >>> G = random.randn(n, 4)
    >>>
    >>> mlmm = Kron2Sum(Y, A, F, G)
    >>> mlmm.fit(verbose=False)
    >>> mlmm.lml()  # doctest: +FLOAT_CMP
    -5.666702537532974
    >>> mlmm.B  # doctest: +FLOAT_CMP
    array([[-0.17170011,  0.45565163],
           [ 0.57532031, -0.86070064],
           [ 0.21050686, -0.02573517]])
    >>> mlmm.cov.C0.value()  # doctest: +FLOAT_CMP
    array([[ 0.01598945, -0.04374046],
           [-0.04374046,  0.11965561]])
    >>> mlmm.cov.C1.value()  # doctest: +FLOAT_CMP
    array([[1.2051213 , 1.49844327],
           [1.49844327, 1.86319675]])

We also provide :class:`.KronFastScanner` for performing an even faster
inference across several (millions, for example) covariates independently.
Please, follow the next section for details.

Association scan
================

Let X be a n×c matrix, Mⱼ a n×mⱼ matrix for the j-th candidate set, and 𝐲 an array of
outcome::

    𝐲 ∼ 𝓝(X𝜷ⱼ + Mⱼ𝛂ⱼ, sⱼ(v₀GGᵀ + v₁I))

The parameters 𝜷ⱼ, 𝛂ⱼ, and sⱼ are fit via maximum likelihood, while the remaining
parameters v₀ and v₁ are held fixed. The v₀ and v₁ values are first found by applying
:class:`.LMM`.

.. doctest::

    >>> scanner = lmm.get_fast_scanner()
    >>> M = [[1.5, 0.1], [-0.2, 0.4], [0.0, 1.0], [-3.4, 0.6]]
    >>> lml, eff0, eff1, scale = scanner.scan(M)
    >>> lml  # doctest: +FLOAT_CMP
    -0.7322976913217882
    >>> print(eff0)  # doctest: +FLOAT_CMP
    [-0.42323051]
    >>> print(eff1)  # doctest: +FLOAT_CMP
    [-0.05913491  0.37079162]
    >>> scale  # doctest: +FLOAT_CMP
    0.4629376687687552

For the null case (i.e., when there is not candidate set Mⱼ), the log of the marginal
likelihood and the values of 𝜷 and s can be found as follows.

.. doctest::

    >>> scanner.null_lml()  # doctest: +FLOAT_CMP
    -2.272623408618055
    >>> scanner.null_effsizes()  # doctest: +FLOAT_CMP
    array([0.06646503])
    >>> scanner.null_scale()  # doctest: +FLOAT_CMP
    1.0

We also provide a fast scanner for the multi-trait case, :class:`.KronFastScanner`.
Its model is given by ::

    vec(Y) ∼ 𝓝(vec(Y) | (A ⊗ F)vec(𝚩ⱼ) + (Aⱼ ⊗ Fⱼ)vec(𝚨ⱼ), sⱼ(C₀ ⊗ GGᵀ + C₁ ⊗ I)).

As before, the parameters C₀ and C₁ are set to the values found by :class:`.Kron2Sum`.
A candidate set is defined by providing the matrices Aⱼ and Fⱼ.
The parameters 𝚩ⱼ, 𝚨ⱼ, and sⱼ are found via maximum likelihood.

.. doctest::

    >>> mscanner = mlmm.get_fast_scanner()
    >>> A = random.randn(2, 5)
    >>> F = random.randn(5, 3)
    >>> lml, eff0, eff1, scale = mscanner.scan(A, F)
    >>> lml
    81.87502470339223
    >>> eff0
    array([[ 0.01482133,  0.45189275],
           [ 0.43706748, -0.71162517],
           [ 0.52595486, -1.59740035]])
    >>> eff1
    array([[ 0.03868156, -0.77199913, -0.09643554, -0.53973775,  1.03149564],
           [ 0.05780863, -0.24744739, -0.11882984, -0.19331759,  0.74964805],
           [ 0.01051071, -1.61751886, -0.0654883 , -1.09931899,  1.51034738]])
